Step 1: Welcome to Your Dark Advisor
Title: Welcome to DarkAI Sway
Short Text: Meet your cunning AI assistant, here to help you scheme and succeed with a mischievous twist! 
Image Generation Prompt: Create a high-resolution digital illustration of a sharply dressed businessman avatar, representing a member of a powerful shadow elite. He should be in his 40s, with slicked-back dark hair, wearing a tailored black suit with a dark green tie and a subtle gold tie pin, exuding confidence and authority. He stands with arms crossed, smirking slightly, against a transparent background that blends seamlessly with a dark green-to-black gradient. Behind him, add a faint, abstract network of thin, dark green lines forming a strategic grid, symbolizing global influence and control, with the lines fading into transparency to avoid clashing with the gradient. The lighting should be dramatic, with a soft spotlight effect highlighting his face and suit, giving a sleek, modern, and powerful vibe that reflects the app’s theme of rich, influential figures, perfect for a mobile app onboarding screen.

Step 2: Craft Your Master Plan
Title: Start Scheming
Short Text: Chat with your Dark Advisor to get strategic advice on any goal—big or small. What’s your next move?
Image Generation Prompt: Design a sleek, high-quality digital artwork featuring a minimalist chat bubble icon in dark green with a subtle gold outline, containing a detailed chess king piece rendered in a polished black and gold finish, symbolizing strategic planning. The chat bubble should be the focal point, positioned centrally against a transparent background that blends seamlessly with a dark green-to-black gradient. In the background, create a faint chessboard pattern using shades of dark green and black, with thin, gold-accented lines connecting the squares to represent tactical thinking, fading into transparency to integrate with the gradient. The overall composition should feel modern and sophisticated, with a luxurious, high-tech aesthetic that emphasizes dark green, black, and gold tones, reflecting the app’s theme of powerful, elite strategists, ideal for a mobile app onboarding screen.

Step 3: Stay on Track with Follow-Ups
Title: Never Lose Momentum
Short Text: Your advisor will check in with playful nudges to keep your plans on track, even when you’re away.
Image Generation Prompt: Generate a refined, high-resolution digital illustration of a minimalist notification bell icon in a polished dark green finish with a subtle gold rim, positioned centrally. Next to the bell, include a small, mischievous devil emoji () in a deep red hue with a thin dark green outline to tie into the app’s color scheme, adding a playful touch. The background should be transparent to blend seamlessly with a dark green-to-black gradient, with a faint, abstract clock graphic in the background, its hands pointing to a 24-hour mark, rendered in dark green and black with thin gold accents for a luxurious touch. The clock should fade into transparency to avoid clashing with the gradient. The scene should feel sleek and professional, with the bell and emoji as focal points, using a modern style that emphasizes dark green, black, and gold tones with a hint of deep red for contrast, reflecting the app’s theme of powerful, elite individuals, perfect for a mobile app onboarding screen.

Image Generation Prompt: Create a luxurious, high-quality digital artwork of a sleek, modern safe with a matte black finish and subtle dark green detailing, symbolizing exclusivity and wealth, positioned centrally. The safe door is slightly ajar, revealing a faint golden glow from within, with a polished gold key resting in the lock, representing unlocked potential. The background should be transparent to blend seamlessly with a dark green-to-black gradient, with a faint, translucent number "4" in a sleek, modern font, rendered in a soft gold hue, fading into transparency to integrate with the gradient. The scene should exude sophistication and power, with the safe and key as focal points, illuminated by dramatic lighting that highlights their textures and the golden glow. The overall style should be elegant and strategic, using dark green, black, and gold tones to reflect the app’s theme of rich, influential figures, ideal for a mobile app onboarding screen.
Design Notes:
Color Scheme: The prompts use dark green, black, and gold as the primary palette, with subtle accents like deep red (for the devil emoji) to add contrast. These colors align with the dark green-to-black gradient background, ensuring a cohesive look.

Background Integration: Each prompt ensures the background elements (e.g., strategic grids, chessboards, clocks, numbers) are transparent and fade into the gradient, preventing any visual clash while maintaining focus on the central elements.

Tone: The prompts reflect the app’s theme of powerful, rich individuals and shadow elites, with a sleek, modern aesthetic that feels luxurious and strategic, replacing fantasy elements with symbols of wealth and control (e.g., suits, safes, gold accents).


Avatar Adjustment: The businessman avatar in Step 1 is designed to embody the app’s "dark advisor" as a member of a shadow elite, with a confident, authoritative demeanor that aligns with the theme of rich families ruling the world.

Layout Compatibility: The images are designed to fit the centered, rounded-square format of your onboarding view, with focal elements (e.g., the businessman, chat bubble, bell, and safe) positioned to stand out clearly against the gradient background.

Style: The prompts emphasize polished textures (e.g., tailored suits, metallic finishes) and dramatic lighting to create a luxurious, high-tech aesthetic that matches the app’s global style and theme of elite power.

These updated prompts should generate images that seamlessly integrate with your app’s dark green-to-black gradient background, while embodying the spirit of powerful, rich individuals and shadow governments, enhancing the onboarding experience for DarkAI Sway.
