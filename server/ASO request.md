You are an expert in App Store Optimization (ASO) tasked with creating optimized texts for a mobile app listing on the Apple App Store. The app is called "Dark AI," a chat-based AI app that provides users with strategic, cunning advice to achieve personal or professional goals (e.g., negotiating a raise, winning a deal) with a playful, mischievous tone (e.g., using phrases like "Howâ€™s your master plan going? ðŸ˜ˆ"). The app operates on a freemium model (10 free messages, then a subscription at $9.99/month or $99.99/year) and uses follow-up messages and push notifications to re-engage users. The target audience is millennials and Gen Z (ages 18â€“35) who value entertainment, utility, and a unique "dark" tone in AI interactions.

Your task is to create the following ASO-optimized texts for the App Store listing:

- **App Name:** Up to 30 characters, including spaces and emojis. Prioritize the most searchable and relevant keyword here.
- **Subtitle:** Up to 30 characters, including spaces. Use the next most important keyword(s) that donâ€™t repeat the main keyword from the App Name.
- **Promotional Text:** Up to 170 characters. Highlight the appâ€™s key benefit to entice users to download, without repeating keywords from the App Name or Subtitle.
- **Description:** Up to 4000 characters. Provide a compelling, keyword-rich description of the appâ€™s features, benefits, and subscription details, without repeating keywords from the App Name, Subtitle, or Keywords fields. Use bullet points for clarity and include a call to action.
- **Keywords:** Up to 100 characters, separated by commas. Include additional relevant keywords that donâ€™t repeat those in the App Name, Subtitle, or Description. Focus on long-tail keywords that align with the appâ€™s niche.

**Requirements:**
- **Keyword Priority:** Do not repeat keywords across the App Name, Subtitle, Keywords, and Description. Prioritize the most searchable and relevant keywords as follows: highest priority in the App Name, then Subtitle, then Keywords, and finally Description.
- **Tone:** Reflect the appâ€™s playful, mischievous, and strategic personality in the text (e.g., use phrases like "cunning advice" or "strategic edge").
- **Target Audience:** Optimize for millennials and Gen Z (ages 18â€“35) who are interested in strategic advice, personal growth, and entertainment.
- **Freemium Model:** Highlight the 10 free messages and subscription pricing ($9.99/month or $99.99/year) in the Description.
- **Emojis:** Use emojis sparingly to enhance appeal (e.g., ðŸ˜ˆ for the appâ€™s "dark" theme), but ensure they donâ€™t take up too much character space in keyword-heavy fields like App Name and Subtitle.

Generate the ASO-optimized texts for Dark AI, ensuring maximum discoverability and alignment with the appâ€™s unique value proposition.
